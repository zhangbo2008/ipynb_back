The goal is to push the cart left or right **so that the pole stays in the equilibrium.**\n\nThe episode ends if:\n- The pole Angle is greater than ±12°\n- Cart Position is greater than ±2.4\n- Episode length is greater than 500\n\nWe get a reward 💰 of +1 every timestep the Pole stays in the equilibrium.","metadata":{"id":"AH_TaLKFXo_8"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"env_id = \"CartPole-v1\"\n# Create the env\nenv = gym.make(env_id)\n\n# Create the evaluation env\neval_env = gym.make(env_id)\n\n# Get the state space and action space\ns_size = env.observation_space.shape[0]  # 表示的是输入状态的数量.\na_size = env.action_space.n              # 表示的是动作状态的数量","metadata":{"id":"POOOk15_K6KA","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-07-06T08:00:22.328266Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-07-06T08:00:22.329274Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-07-06T08:00:22.344761Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-07-06T08:00:22.329229Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-07-06T08:00:22.343770Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":7,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(\"_____OBSERVATION SPACE_____ \\n\")\nprint(\"The State Space is: \", s_size)\nprint('action_size ', a_size)\nprint(\"Sample observation\", env.observation_space.sample()) # Get a random observation","metadata":{"id":"FMLFrjiBNLYJ","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-07-06T08:01:38.125008Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-07-06T08:01:38.125422Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-07-06T08:01:38.132029Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-07-06T08:01:38.125388Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-07-06T08:01:38.130915Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":9,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"_____OBSERVATION SPACE_____ \n\nThe State Space is:  4\naction_size  2\nSample observation [ 8.6825538e-01  1.2542409e+38  2.8198969e-01 -1.1636652e+38]\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(\"\\n _____ACTION SPACE_____ \\n\")\nprint(\"The Action Space is: \", a_size)\nprint(\"Action Space Sample\", env.action_space.sample()) # Take a random action","metadata":{"id":"Lu6t4sRNNWkN","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-07-06T08:02:11.521641Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-07-06T08:02:11.522093Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-07-06T08:02:11.528451Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-07-06T08:02:11.522054Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-07-06T08:02:11.527414Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":23,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"\n _____ACTION SPACE_____ \n\nThe Action Space is:  2\nAction Space Sample 1\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Let's build the Reinforce Architecture\nThis implementation is based on two implementations:\n- [PyTorch official Reinforcement Learning example](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/blob/main/reinforcement_learning/reinforce.py)\n- [Udacity Reinforce](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning/blob/master/reinforce/REINFORCE.ipynb)\n- [Improvement of the integration by Chris1nexus](https://github.com/huggingface/deep-rl-class/pull/95)\n\n<img src=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-deep-rl-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit6/reinforce.png\" alt=\"Reinforce\"/>","metadata":{"id":"7SJMJj3WaFOz"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"So we want:\n- Two fully connected layers (fc1 and fc2).\n- Using ReLU as activation function of fc1\n- Using Softmax to output a probability distribution over actions","metadata":{"id":"49kogtxBODX8"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Solution","metadata":{"id":"rOMrdwSYOWSC"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"I make a mistake, can you guess where?\n\n- To find out let's make a forward pass:","metadata":{"id":"ZTGWL4g2eM5B"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"- Here we see that the error says `ValueError: The value argument to log_prob must be a Tensor`\n\n- It means that `action` in `m.log_prob(action)` must be a Tensor **but it's not.**\n\n- Do you know why?

This way, you will be ready to participate in the **AI vs AI challenges where you'll train your agents\nto compete against other agents in a snowball fight and a soccer game.**\n\nSounds fun? See you next time!\n\nFinally, we would love **to hear what you think of the course and how we can improve it**.
